First, all of my original poems highlight aspects of my identity as it shows what sports I love and how it personally connects to me. It also shows the things I do not like, such as school. However, my poems also demonstrate some things I love, such as blue skies. Blue skies, however, are not directly talking about the sky, when in reality it is talking about happiness and finding joy in dark times, something that I truly value as there is no point in finding the darkness in a good situation. This is apparent when it states: “Blue skies breathe, / Life and energy into people.” This quote clearly shows how blue skies make people happy, symbolising how people are happier when they find the good in life.

Secondly, I chose my self-selected poem- The Cities Inside Us -because it demonstrates how everyone has emotions from deep inside them and everyone has their own interactions, thoughts, opinions, and feelings that they never share with anyone. And it's this, it’s these emotions that thoughts and opinions that shape who we are and how we interact with the world around us, it's this that shapes our identity. This is shown clearly in the text when it states: “We live in secret cities / And we travel unmapped roads. / We speak words between us that we recognize / But which cannot be looked up” (1-4 Ríos). This shows how we all have our own thoughts and emotions that only we understand. This is how my self-selected poem connects to my identity.
