    <h3>Breakpoint</h3>

    <p class="poem-text">
     The day is bright and vibrant.<br>
The hot sun hits my neck,<br>
A bead of sweat rolls down onto my shirt.<br>
<br>
“Damn,” I say, “It’s hot”.<br>
“Should’ve brought a hat,” he says.<br>
Every day, every hour, I spend with him. Practicing.<br>
He makes me play,<br>
And through the heat, I know that this,<br>
This, is what it takes -to be great.<br>
<br>
So, I walk, walk up to the base line.<br>
Griping, squeezing, the fuzzy green ball in my hand.<br>
I look up, the sun blinding my eyes.<br>
<br>
“Again, the hat would block out that sun,” he shouts from across the clay court.
Almost every day he says that.<br>
I block him out,<br>
<br>
He’s just noise.<br>
They’re all just noise.<br>
<br>
I look up again, squinting.<br>
I toss the ball up,<br>
High,<br>
Higher,<br>
Highest.<br>
And then,<br>
When it reaches it’s peak,<br>
And begins to descend,<br>
I hit it,<br>
Slapping it down with my racket.<br>
<br>
I look forward,<br>
Trying to see what I made with that serve.<br>
<br>
It looks perfect as it crosses my side,<br>
 about to go over the net,<br>
And…<br>
DINK!<br>
It hits the top of the net,<br>
And falls,<br> 
Falls down onto my side.<br>
<br>
“Let!” He yells, hands cupped to his mouth.<br>
<br>
I sigh.<br>
I’ll have to do that again.<br>

    <h3>Gotta Crack an Egg to Make An Omlet</h3>

    <p class="poem-text">
      Tk- tk- tk,<br>
FWOOSH!<br>
The heat hits my face,<br>
like a warm summer day.<br>
And- with, a small stick of butter,<br>
The pan begins to sizzle.<br>
<br>
The sink is turned on,<br>
Water pours onto my hand.<br>
Water, still dripping- from my hand,<br>
A flick, flick, flick-ing motion,<br>
Onto the pan.<br>
The grease jumps,<br>
Up, from the skillet<br>
<br>
The pan is ready.<br>
<br>
The white egg,<br>
 white as snow,<br>
It is cracked on the edge of the pan.<br>
The fingers pry,<br>
Pry the white oval thing,<br>
Open so the gooey clear liquid pours out,<br>
Along with a yolk,<br>
So yellow, it could be,<br>
hotter than the sun.<br>
<br>
So the egg sizzles, sizzles,<br>
And the goo slowly turns into a white,<br>
Thing that is smooth.<br>
Smooth, and slippery.<br>
<br>
The thing solidifies on the bottom,<br>
And the thing is flipped,<br>
Flipped with a metal spatula.<br>
<br>
The bottom is brown, a bit overcooked.<br>
But it's perfect.<br>
The imperfections are perfect.<br>
<br>
A pinch of salt,<br>
A dash of pepper,<br>
And a quick flick of garlic.<br>
<br>
The egg is rested on a plate,<br>
Atop- a piece of toasted bread.<br>
<br>
The egg, is done.<br>
<br>
Oh flip, I dropped it.

    <h3>Running The Wall</h3>

    <p class="poem-text">
      There I lay, dangling from the wall,<br>
So close, but so far from the top<br>
“There’s one to your left!” he called.<br>
“No it's too far! I’ll fall!”<br>
One wrong move, and I’ll flop.<br>
<br>
My fingers cried in pain! If only I was tall,<br>
Tall enough to reach the top, and then touch the belay lock.<br>
Should I continue, or should I stall?<br>
But there! I found it! A path to take! A hall!<br>
No! It’s too far! I’ll have to stop.<br>
<br>
And so, I had to fall;<br>
fall because my fingers couldn’t lock.<br>
They couldn’t lock onto the wall.<br>
The silence screamed as I descended- it didn’t help me at all.<br>
I had to wipe up my shame, wipe it up with a mop.<br>
<br>
I can do it again, the wall!<br>
Yes, I will do it again! And this time, I’ll reach the top.<br>
I won’t fall!<br>
I’ll show them all:<br>
From stone to wall,<br>
I can hop<br>
