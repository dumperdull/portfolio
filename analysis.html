<h2>Poem Analysis</h2>

<p style="max-width:500px;margin-bottom:40px;color:#555;">
This is a TPCASTT review of the poem <b>"The Cities Inside Us"</b> by <b>Alberto Ríos</b>. Below is an organised recreation of the TPCASTT analysis 
</p>

<!-- ANALYSIS 1 -->

<div class="analysis-sheet card">

  <div class="row">
    <div class="label">Title</div>
    <div class="value">The name "The City Inside Us" would make one assume that it has to do with the way we think and the world inside us that we keep to ourselves and don't share to anyone; so complex it is like a "city" in some sense.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="label">Paraphrase</div>
    <div class="value">We all live in hidden cities, and we go about roads that have never been traveled. We speak words that only we understand, and cannot be looked up, because they are our words. They come from deep inside us, and only we understand them. You and I are the only ones who live in this secret city inside us. All the cars we have driven and people we have seen pass us by as well as all the places we have been. However, even though they passed us, they will never disappear. It's loud inside this city when we talk to others outside of it, and we hope that no sound from the inside comes out.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="label">Connotation</div>
    <div class="value">The author of this poem makes it sound like they do not want any of their deepest thoughts to slio out. We can see this when it states: "It's loud inside us, in there, and when we speak / In the outside world / We have to hope that some of that sound / Does not come out... (17-20 Ríos).</div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="label">Attitude</div>
    <div class="value">The author's attitude is not entirely apparent; the author has a subtle way of showing a desperation to keep all of their feelings inside and not show their true self.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="label">Style</div>
    <div class="value">Stanzas: 11
      <br>
      <p>Lines: 22</p>
      <br>
      <p>The poem's lines are of medium length. All eleven stanza's consist of two lines each staza, meaning the poem is relatively organised. 
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="label">Title Revisited</div>
    <div class="value">The title now makes clear sense as the poem is about how everyone has a "hidden city" inside of them with people and houses that never go away. This symbolises how everyone has their private thoughts and thoughts that can never be erased.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="label">Theme</div>
    <div class="value">The theme of "The Cities Inside Us" is that everyone has their own thoughts and side of them that they don't need to share with the public world, and that's okay.</div>
